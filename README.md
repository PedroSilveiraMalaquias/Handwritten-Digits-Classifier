# Handwritten Digits Classifier
A neural network model to classify handwritten digits provided as inputs taken from the MNIST dataset.

## Usage

After download the source code, just hit the run button in your IDE. We are takin inputs from the MNIST dataset,which contains tens of thousands of scanned images of 
handwritten digits, together with their correct classifications. MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, 
the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology. The dataset is the mnist.plk.gz file.

This work was an implementation of the Neural Nertwork proposed by Michael A. Nielsen, in his book "Neural Network and Deep Learning", Determination Press, 2015. I made
some changes and tried to write in a more object-oriented way. I also tried to make easier to read each function that the neural network uses in its learning process.

I am also making available my personal notes, which I wrote while I was studying professor Michael's book. There you can check the Activation Function, the Input Format, 
and the Output Format we are using in this project. Besides, you can check the cost function and the chosen strategies applied to perform the Gradient Descent and the 
Backpropagation steps. I tried to summarize my studies about building a neural network from the scratch as much as possible. 

Feel free to reach me about any improuvements.
